        <h1>Flower's beauty</h1>
        <p>Her stem stood tall against the horizon
            moving gently through the wind.
            Her fragrance of restful ease
            drifts above the high maple leaves.
            She sits in silent confidence above the grass.
            Her vibrant colors to never pass.
            A presence that makes the hours still.
            The song she sings whispers through the pines
            as the branches bow low all around.
            She wears her heart on her bright pedals.
            He beheld her from the shadows of the trail.
            While she danced before him in the light of the valley.
            He took her in, then let her go
            Satisfied, he kept on the road.
            She had gone her way.
            He had gone his.
            Leaving behind a blooming blossom,
            a golden flower,
            a passing friend.</p>
